### 🍱 Yahaha! Hello there!

I'm one of *these devs* that loves doing development on his own time.
Running a HomeLab and all. FOSS is life!

Here's an abbreviated list of things I do and/or contribute to:

- 👺 Proud member of [zdharma-continuum](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum).
The main project is [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit), a
plugin manager for zsh. But there are a lot more projects in there. Shoot me a
email if you want to get involved ;)
- 🏣 OP/OG creator of [pykeepass](https://github.com/libkeepass/pykeepass),
a library for interacting with [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) databases in
Python
- 🍥 Lots of other stuff, mainly python, shell, k8s and
[Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/core) stuff. Just look at my
repos!

⚡ Fun fact: I'm really good at pretending to be french !
